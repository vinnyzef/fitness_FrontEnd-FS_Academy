# FrontEnd Portion of FitnessTracker Project
Our team is working on a project that utilizes JavaScript and APIs to create a website where users can create posts, add tags, and leave comments. We are using an open-source API to store and retrieve data, and are excited to contribute to the open-source community by making our code available for others to use and build upon.

This project is a great opportunity for us to develop our skills in web development, APIs, and collaboration. We encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to join our team and help us make this project the best it can be.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and we look forward to collaborating with you!
